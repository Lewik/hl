hl
==

debug class hl
it's one more var_dump

install:
include 'path/to/hl_include_it.php'
or to use in all projects
in php.ini find auto_prepend_file directive and write:
auto_prepend_file = "path/to/hl_include_it.php"
and restart apache

File helpers php contains shortcut helpers to use hl class.

You can rename hl-class and helpers to avoid conflicts.

Also hl-class writes hl_log.html, so you can debug even you have no access to phps logs
